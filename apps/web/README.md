## üóÇ Folder Layout

- `apps/web`: web entrypoint. It contains all of the pages entrypoint and backend API routes.

- `packages`: shared packages that used across apps (web + native)
  - `app`: most of the code are inside this folder. We organize all the code according to their features and uses.

## üèÅ Start The App

### Environment Variables

**First, clone this repository,**, go to `apps/web` directory, and you need to make an environment variable file, or just copy the environment variables example using this command below.

```bash
# copy the .env.example into .env file
$ cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

After that you need some API keys. For that, you can contact me (see contact links in the root README).

### Running The Project

After you get the API keys you can follow these steps below.

- Install dependencies from the root directory: `yarn`
- Go to `apps/web`
- Run `yarn dev`
