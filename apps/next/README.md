## üóÇ Folder Layout

- `apps/next` entry points for the web app

For the web app, it is fully built inside this `apps/next` directory. For now, we are not using any `react-native` component here. We adopt an incremental migration process, so this might be changed.

## üèÅ Start The App

### Environment Variables

**First, clone this repository,**, go to `apps/next` directory, and you need to make an environment variable file, or just copy the environment variables example using this command below.

```bash
# copy the .env.example into .env file
$ cp .env.example .env
```

After that you need some API keys. For that, you can contact me at the contact section below.

### Running The Project

After you get the API keys you can follow these steps below.

- Install dependencies from the root directory: `yarn`
- Run the app: `yarn web`
