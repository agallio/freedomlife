> **Note:** Issues must include both Description and Acceptance Criteria sections to be considered valid. Incomplete issues will be automatically closed.

## Description

<!-- Required: Provide a clear and detailed description of the feature you're proposing and explain how it would benefit the project. Be specific about the problem it solves or the value it adds.

Example:
Add a dark mode theme option to the dashboard interface. Many users work late at night or in low-light conditions, and a dark mode would reduce eye strain and improve accessibility. This would align with modern UI/UX practices and meet frequently requested user feedback. -->

## Acceptance Criteria

<!-- Required: List specific, measurable criteria that must be met for this feature to be considered complete. This helps ensure clear testing requirements and successful implementation.

Example:
- Users can toggle between light and dark modes via a button in the navigation bar
- Dark mode preserves all existing functionality while updating the color scheme
- Color scheme meets WCAG 2.1 accessibility standards for contrast
- Theme preference persists across sessions using local storage
- Smooth transition animation when switching themes -->

## Technical Implementation

<!-- (Optional) Share any insights about the implementation approach, such as:
- Relevant code areas that may need modification
- Architectural considerations
- Potential dependencies or prerequisites
- Performance implications

Example:
- Create a new ThemeContext using React Context API
- Add CSS variables for color schemes in styles/themes.css
- Modify the Navigation component to include the theme toggle
- Update component styles to use CSS variables instead of hard-coded colors
- Add local storage integration in utils/themeStorage.js -->

## Required Tasks

<!-- (Optional) Break down the implementation into specific, actionable tasks. Add or modify tasks as needed during development.

Example:
- [ ] Create theme switching infrastructure
- [ ] Design and implement theme toggle button
- [ ] Define dark mode color palette
- [ ] Update component styles to support themes
- [ ] Add theme persistence
- [ ] Write tests for theme switching
- [ ] Update documentation -->
